# Roadmap

These are things that we have expressed interest in but haven't implemented yet. There is no order, if you feel like you can complete one of the tasks. Feel free to fork the project and send a pull request with the new code.

  <dt>Rich Clipboard</dt>
  <dd>The Flash Clipboard API supports RichText (RTF), HTML, and custom data. We want to enable those as feasible. See Issues [#143](https://github.com/zeroclipboard/ZeroClipboard/issues/143) and [#152](https://github.com/zeroclipboard/ZeroClipboard/issues/152).</dd>

  <dt>ActionScript tests</dt>
  <dd>We want to setup a unit test suite for the Flash file. See Issue [#43](https://github.com/zeroclipboard/ZeroClipboard/issues/43).</dd>

  <dt>HTML5 Clipboard API</dt>
  <dd>In a perfect world we wouldn't need ZeroClipboard, and the browsers would just take care of it. We would like to write ZeroClipboard to use the browser's clipboard API when available. See Issues [#171](https://github.com/zeroclipboard/ZeroClipboard/issues/171) and [#105](https://github.com/zeroclipboard/ZeroClipboard/issues/105).</dd>
